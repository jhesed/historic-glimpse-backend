Rodrigo Duterte signed the Paris agreement on Climate Change. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n This was despite the president\'s initial declaration that he intended to pull the Philippines out of the pact, believing that the small countries would be disadvantaged by it. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n The Paris Agreement\'s main aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of the climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below the 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels. This in turn, is to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n The Philippines became the 138th state party to the agreement.', 'May this agreement on climate change be fulfilled to the letter by all state parties involved. May the Filipinos learn to truly practice pro-environmentalism and be held accountable for failures committed against the nature and environment.', 'The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant. 6 Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth\'s inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left. <br/>\r\n–<b> Isaiah 24:5-6 </b>', '<i>In human history, we can see sparkles of God\'s redeeming stories</i><br/>\r\n- Pastor Jose Tacadena', 'https://bit.ly/3pdUU3y', 1, NULL, 'Do you know that even the Bible attests that the deterioration of the earth and the environment is caused by men themselves?');
